# RR project - Sentiment Analysis of hate tweets
Reproduction of an already built RNN machine learning model. The goal of this project is to find possible flaws in the model by using a different dataset in order to improve and optimise it.

The model was developed using Jupyter Notebook (6.1.4) and Google Colaboratory platforms. 

Packages used in the model:
 - python (3.8.0)
 - keras (2.9.0)
 - nltk (3.5)
 - numpy (1.22.4)
 - pandas (1.0.5)
 - matplotlib (3.3.2)
 - regex (2020.10.15)
 - spacy (3.2.2)
 - tensorflow (2.9.1)
 - wordcloud (1.8.1)
 - scikit-learn (0.23.1)
 - sklearn (0.0)

We used GloVe as the pre-trained word vector, which can be downloaded from the following link:

More specifically, we used **glove.twitter.27B.200d**.
